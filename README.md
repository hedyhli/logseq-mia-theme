## Logseq miA theme

A [Logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq) theme inspired by [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/) and [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer).

For user interface elements, the 'system' font is usedâ€”[San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) on macOS. User content is rendered using the [iA Writer Quattro and Mono](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts) fonts.

The colour scheme is inspired by *iA Writer* and *macOS*.


### Using the theme

You can install the theme using the *Logseq marketplace*.

Go to **Plugins** from the main menu (click on '...' in top right of the Logseq window ), select **Marketplace** and then **Themes**. Each theme has an 'Install' link.

If you don't see **Plugins** on the main menu, you need to enable plug-ins: go to Logseq **Settings** from the main menu, then the **Advanced** section, and enable the **Plug-in system** and restart Logseq.

If you don't want to use the marketplace, you can add the following line to your `custom.css` page in *Logseq*:

```
@import url('https://playerofgames.github.io/logseq-mia-theme/mia.css');
```
