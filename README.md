## Logseq miA theme

A [Logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq) theme inspired by [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/) and [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer).

For user interface elements, the 'system' font is usedâ€”[San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) on macOS. User content is rendered using the [iA Writer Quattro and Mono](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts) fonts.

The colour scheme is inspired by *iA Writer* and *macOS*.
